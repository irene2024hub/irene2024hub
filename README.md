Hi, I’m Irene Ufuoma Ayakazi 👋

I’m a Data Analyst and Data Scientist with formal training and practical experience across Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I’m also actively building a strong, hands-on foundation in AI Automation, with real projects to show for it.

- I’ve completed intensive training with Incubator Hub, where I worked across data analysis, machine learning, data science, and AI concepts. Along the way, I built and deployed multiple projects on different problem domains, focusing on practical use cases rather than textbook examples.

- I also completed an internship with Elite Global AI, where I gained real-world exposure, improved my analytical thinking, and collaborated on applied AI and data-driven tasks. Currently, I’m expanding into AI automation, designing workflows and automation solutions that improve efficiency and reduce manual effort.

What I do;

- Data Analysis and Insights Generation

- Python for Data Science and Machine Learning

- Applied Machine Learning projects

- AI and Data-driven problem solving

- AI Automation workflows and process optimization


**Projects & Portfolio**

- I’ve built a strong technical portfolio on GitHub, featuring projects across:

- Data analysis and visualization

- Machine learning models

- Data science case studies

- AI automation projects


- Each project is documented to explain my thinking, approach, and results.
